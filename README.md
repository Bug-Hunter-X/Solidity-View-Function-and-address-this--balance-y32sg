# Solidity View Function and address(this).balance
This example demonstrates a potential issue with using `address(this).balance` in a Solidity `view` function. While functionally correct, it can trigger warnings in static analysis tools due to the nature of how `balance` is accessed.

## Bug
The bug lies in the seemingly innocuous use of `address(this).balance` within a `view` function.  Linters or static analysis might raise a flag because, although `balance` is a read-only property, the underlying mechanism to retrieve the balance could potentially involve an external call (depending on the context), leading to the function not being truly 'view'.

## Solution
The solution is to refactor or document the code carefully to communicate that the balance retrieval in this specific context is a safe operation, unlikely to result in external calls. The most important point is that the function is not modified to avoid potential issues.
